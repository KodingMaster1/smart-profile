## üåç Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

### For Local Development
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### For Vercel Deployment

1. Go to **Storage**
2. Create a new bucket called `resumes`
3. Set the bucket to private
4. Create a new bucket called `portfolios`
5. Set the bucket to public

### Storage Policies
Add the following policies to your storage buckets:

#### For `resumes` bucket:
```sql
-- Allow users to upload their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'resumes' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to view their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'resumes' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to update their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'resumes' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete their own resumes
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own resumes" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'resumes' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

#### For `portfolios` bucket:
```sql
-- Allow users to upload portfolio images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload portfolio images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'portfolios' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow public access to portfolio images
CREATE POLICY "Public access to portfolio images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'portfolios');

-- Allow users to update their portfolio images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update portfolio images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'portfolios' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete their portfolio images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete portfolio images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'portfolios' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

## üîç Step 8: Test the Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try to register a new user
4. Verify that:
   - User registration works
   - Profile is automatically created
   - Alert settings are automatically created
   - You can log in and access the dashboard

## üìä Step 9: Monitor and Debug

### Check Logs
1. Go to **Logs** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Monitor for any errors or issues

### Database Inspector
1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Verify that tables are created correctly
3. Check that sample data was inserted

### Real-time
1. Go to **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Enable real-time for tables that need it (optional)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API key" error**
   - Verify your environment variables are correct
   - Make sure you're using the anon key, not the service role key

   - Check that RLS policies are created correctly
   - Verify user authentication is working

3. **"Email not sent" errors**
   - Check SMTP configuration
   - Verify email templates are set up

4. **"Storage access denied" errors**
